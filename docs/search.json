    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nFor mrm2, the t-test and regression output returned NaN values, likely due to missing or corrupted entries in the column. We will revisit this variable after inspecting the data.\nFor freq, the regression showed a coefficient on treatment of –0.012, with a p-value of 0.912, indicating no statistically significant difference between groups.\n\nThese results imply that the treatment and control groups were well-balanced with respect to prior donation behavior. This supports the assumption that any difference in outcomes (such as donation rates) can be attributed to the treatment rather than pre-existing differences.\n\nWhy is Table 1 in the paper?\nTable 1 in Karlan & List (2007) serves exactly this purpose: it demonstrates that randomization worked. If treatment and control groups are balanced on observable pre-treatment characteristics, readers can have greater confidence in the causal interpretation of subsequent comparisons. Including a balance table is a standard best practice in experimental papers, especially when the goal is to isolate treatment effects.\n\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Split groups\ncontrol_gave = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"gave\"]\ntreat_gave = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\n\n# Run t-test\nttest_ind(control_gave, treat_gave)\n\nTtestResult(statistic=-3.101361000543946, pvalue=0.0019274025949016988, df=50081.0)\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Define X and y\nX = sm.add_constant(df[\"treatment\"])\ny = df[\"gave\"]\n\n# Run OLS regression\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\nmodel.summary2().tables[1][[\"Coef.\", \"Std.Err.\", \"P&gt;|t|\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoef.\nStd.Err.\nP&gt;|t|\n\n\n\n\nconst\n0.017858\n0.001101\n4.779032e-59\n\n\ntreatment\n0.004180\n0.001348\n1.927403e-03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first tested whether the treatment group was more likely to donate using a t-test. The result was statistically significant (p ≈ 0.002), indicating that the difference in donation rates between treatment and control is unlikely to be due to chance.\nTo confirm this, we ran a simple linear regression with gave as the dependent variable and treatment as the explanatory variable. The estimated treatment effect was approximately 0.42 percentage points, meaning that individuals who received a matching grant letter were 0.42 percent more likely to donate. The result was again statistically significant with p less than 0.01.\nThese findings align with Table 2a, Panel A in Karlan and List (2007), and suggest that simply mentioning a matching grant in a fundraising letter can causally increase the probability of donation. This highlights that even subtle framing changes in solicitation messages can meaningfully affect charitable behavior, likely by making the act of giving feel more impactful or urgent.\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n#| label: gave-probit\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| \n# Define X and y\nX = sm.add_constant(df[\"treatment\"])\ny = df[\"gave\"]\n# Run Probit model\nprobit_model = sm.Probit(y, X).fit()\nprobit_model.summary2().tables[1][[\"Coef.\", \"Std.Err.\", \"P&gt;|z|\"]]\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoef.\nStd.Err.\nP&gt;|z|\n\n\n\n\nconst\n-2.100141\n0.023316\n0.000000\n\n\ntreatment\n0.086785\n0.027879\n0.001852\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n#| label: ttest-match-ratios\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\n# Filter only treated individuals\ntreated = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1]\n\n# Define match groups\ngave_1to1 = treated[(treated[\"ratio2\"] == 0) & (treated[\"ratio3\"] == 0)][\"gave\"]\ngave_2to1 = treated[treated[\"ratio2\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\ngave_3to1 = treated[treated[\"ratio3\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\n\n# Run t-tests\nt_1_vs_2 = ttest_ind(gave_1to1, gave_2to1)\nt_2_vs_3 = ttest_ind(gave_2to1, gave_3to1)\n\nt_1_vs_2, t_2_vs_3\n\n(TtestResult(statistic=-0.96504713432247, pvalue=0.33453168549723933, df=22265.0),\n TtestResult(statistic=-0.05011583793874515, pvalue=0.9600305283739325, df=22261.0))\n\n\nWe compare the response rates between different match ratios using t-tests. The comparison between the 1:1 and 2:1 match groups yields a p-value of approximately 0.335, and the comparison between 2:1 and 3:1 yields a p-value near 0.96. These results are not statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level.\nThis means that increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 or from 2:1 to 3:1 does not make individuals more likely to donate. The findings support the comment on page 8 of Karlan and List (2007) that larger match ratios do not meaningfully improve donation rates. The presence of a match itself seems to matter, but further increasing its size does not have additional impact on behavior.\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n#| label: regression-match-ratios\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# ratio1 is the baseline group, so we drop it\nX = treated[[\"ratio2\", \"ratio3\"]]\nX = sm.add_constant(X)\ny = treated[\"gave\"]\n\nmatch_model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\nmatch_model.summary2().tables[1][[\"Coef.\", \"Std.Err.\", \"P&gt;|t|\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoef.\nStd.Err.\nP&gt;|t|\n\n\n\n\nconst\n0.020749\n0.001391\n3.981333e-50\n\n\nratio2\n0.001884\n0.001968\n3.382805e-01\n\n\nratio3\n0.001984\n0.001968\n3.133172e-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe regress the binary outcome variable gave on two dummy variables: ratio2 and ratio3, representing 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios respectively. The baseline group is ratio1, which corresponds to a 1:1 match.\nThe estimated coefficients on ratio2 and ratio3 are approximately 0.0019 and 0.0020. These values indicate that donors offered a 2:1 or 3:1 match were about 0.19 or 0.20 percentage points more likely to donate than those offered a 1:1 match. However, both estimates have p-values well above conventional significance thresholds: 0.338 for ratio2 and 0.313 for ratio3.\nThis lack of statistical significance means we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed differences are due to chance. The results suggest that increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 or 3:1 does not lead to a meaningful increase in the probability of donation.\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n#| label: match-ratio-differences-2\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\n# Direct differences in donation rates from data\nrate_diff_2_vs_1 = gave_2to1.mean() - gave_1to1.mean()\nrate_diff_3_vs_2 = gave_3to1.mean() - gave_2to1.mean()\n\n# Differences from regression coefficients\ncoef_2_vs_1 = match_model.params[\"ratio2\"]  # relative to baseline (1:1)\ncoef_3_vs_2 = match_model.params[\"ratio3\"] - match_model.params[\"ratio2\"]\n\n(rate_diff_2_vs_1, rate_diff_3_vs_2), (coef_2_vs_1, coef_3_vs_2)\n\n((0.0018842510217149944, 0.00010002398025293902),\n (0.0018842510217141856, 0.00010002398025350584))\n\n\nThe difference in donation rates between the 2:1 and 1:1 match ratios is approximately 0.19 percentage points, and between the 3:1 and 2:1 match ratios is about 0.01 percentage points. These differences are very small and not statistically significant.\nBoth the direct calculation from the data and the regression-based estimates lead to the same conclusion: increasing the size of the match offer does not meaningfully increase the likelihood that a donor gives. This implies that larger matching ratios are not more effective than a simple 1:1 match.\nThese results reinforce the interpretation in Karlan and List (2007) that what matters is the presence of a match, not how generous it is. Fundraising efforts may be better off focusing on whether to include a match offer rather than trying to optimize its size.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n#| label: amount-regression-full\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Define inputs\nX = sm.add_constant(df[\"treatment\"])\ny = df[\"amount\"]\n\n# Fit model\namount_model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\namount_model.summary2().tables[1][[\"Coef.\", \"Std.Err.\", \"P&gt;|t|\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoef.\nStd.Err.\nP&gt;|t|\n\n\n\n\nconst\n0.813268\n0.067418\n1.843438e-33\n\n\ntreatment\n0.153605\n0.082561\n6.282029e-02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ran a regression of donation amount on treatment status using the full sample, which includes both donors and non-donors.\nThe estimated treatment effect is approximately 0.15 dollars, meaning that individuals in the treatment group gave slightly more on average than those in the control group. However, the p-value is around 0.063, which is slightly above the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance.\nThis means that we cannot confidently conclude that the matching donation offer increases the total amount donated. The result suggests a possible positive effect, but it is not statistically robust enough to rule out chance. It appears that the treatment might have a small effect on total giving, but further evidence would be needed to confirm it.\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n#| label: amount-regression-full\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Define inputs\nX = sm.add_constant(df[\"treatment\"])\ny = df[\"amount\"]\n\n# Fit model\namount_model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\namount_model.summary()\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

No.\n3.23\n\n\n\nNotes:[1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.\n\n\nWe ran a linear regression of the amount donated on treatment status, using the full sample that includes individuals who did not donate.\nThe treatment coefficient is approximately 0.15, suggesting that individuals in the treatment group gave about 15 cents more on average than those in the control group. However, this estimate is only marginally statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.063.\nThis result provides some weak evidence that matching offers may increase average donations, but it is not strong enough to be conclusive.\nBecause this analysis includes non-donors whose amount is zero, the estimated coefficient captures both the treatment’s effect on the likelihood of giving and on the amount given conditional on giving. As a result, the coefficient does not have a clear causal interpretation for donation size alone. It blends two effects: whether people donate and how much they donate if they do. To isolate the effect on donation size, we need to restrict the sample to donors only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe create separate histograms of donation amounts for the control and treatment groups, including only individuals who made a donation. A red vertical line marks the mean donation amount in each group.\nThe shapes of the distributions are similar, with most donations concentrated at smaller amounts. Both groups have a long right tail due to a small number of larger donations. The average donation in the treatment group appears slightly lower than in the control group.\nThis visual impression is consistent with our earlier regression analysis, which showed no statistically significant treatment effect on the donation amount, conditional on giving. Overall, the match offer does not appear to influence how much people give once they decide to donate."

Each individual simulation is based on a Bernoulli process with probabilities 0.022 for the treatment group and 0.018 for the control group.\nInitially, the cumulative average fluctuates widely, but as the number of simulations increases, the fluctuations diminish and the average converges toward the true difference in means, which is 0.004.\nThis demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers. As the sample size grows, the sample average becomes a more reliable estimate of the expected value. In this case, with enough simulations, the average observed treatment effect approximates the true treatment effect.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histograms show the distribution of the difference in means between treatment and control groups across 1000 simulated experiments, for sample sizes of 50, 200, 500, and 1000.\nAs the sample size increases, the distribution becomes more concentrated around the true average difference. At smaller sample sizes such as 50, the distribution is wide, and zero lies well within the center. This reflects a high degree of uncertainty in small samples.\nAt larger sample sizes, especially n = 1000, the distribution becomes narrower and more symmetric, approximating a normal distribution. In these cases, zero is closer to the edge or tail of the distribution. This means that with larger samples, we are less likely to observe a difference near zero if the true difference is positive, as it is in this simulation.\nOverall, this confirms the Central Limit Theorem and illustrates how increased sample size improves our ability to detect small but real differences between groups."
